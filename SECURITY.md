If you discover a security vulnerability in NoPASARAN, we appreciate your assistance in notifying us in a responsible manner.

### Reporting Method

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible to aid in reproducing and resolving the issue. Include the following information:

- Description of the vulnerability and its potential impact

- Any supporting evidence, such as code snippets or screenshots

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices:

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before it has been addressed.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to assess and address the reported vulnerability before making any public statements.
- If you discover the same vulnerability reported by someone else, please refrain from sharing the details until it has been resolved and publicly disclosed by us.

1. **Acknowledgement**: You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours, confirming that we have received it.

2. **Evaluation and Verification**: We will evaluate the vulnerability report and verify its validity. If additional information is required, we may contact you for clarification.

3. **Resolution and Progress Updates**: Upon confirmation of a valid vulnerability, we will prioritize its resolution and keep you informed about the progress towards resolving the issue.

4. **Security Acknowledgement**: Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will acknowledge your contribution and recognize your responsible disclosure, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
